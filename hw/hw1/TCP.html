                <h3>Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)</h3>
                <p>
                    TCP's main function is to make sure that data is transmitted reliably. As 
                    stated, data is sent through the internet in packets. TCP's job is to send 
                    these packets safely as possible. It has to make sure that all packets are 
                    sent without being lost. You don't want sentences in your messages or pictures
                    disappearing when you send them. It also has to make sure they are received and
                    put back together in order.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    All packets are numbered so as to make sure they are sent out in order. There is
                    also a deadline or timeout time so that if a set amount of time has passed and there
                    is no acknowledgment from the receiver then the sender can take that as a cue to resend
                    the packet. Out of order packets are also not acknowledged as to make sure packets are 
                    assembled in order.
                    
                </p>
